# Linux Concepts

#### 1. How does the internet work?
The Internet works with optical fibres/fibre cables, which connect us through a data centre where all the data gets stored and transmitted through cables. 
Internet service providers install the router, wifi and other devices for us, and through this router and broadband, an IP address gets generated and identifies the devices to send the data.


DATA CENTER —-----> CABLES—---------> CABLES PROVIDER—-----> INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER(ISP)-------------------------> GENERATE THE IP ADDRESS TO IDENTIFIES THE DEVICES—---> SEND DATA

#### 2. What is a server ?
A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client.

Server - To Provide the information.
Client - To Request the information.

Example - 

YouTube —--------->     DNS (Server) —----->      IP Address of server                                            


Facebook.com —-------> ISP (checks the internet connection)---------> Optical fibre flows the data information —----> data centre has that application which helps to stream in your mobile. 

#### 3. Difference between web servers and application servers - 

#### 1. How a web server works -
   
A web server is technology that hosts a website’s code and data. When you enter a URL in your browser, the URL is actually the address identifier of the web server.

Your browser and web server communicate as follows:

a. The browser uses the URL to find the server’s IP address.

b. The browser sends an HTTP request for information

c. The web server communicates with a database server to find the relevant data

d. The web server returns static content such as HTML pages, images, videos, or files in an HTTP response to the browser

e. The browser then displays the information to you.

A website that hosts static content like blogs, header images, or articles can run on a web server. However, most websites and web applications are much more interactive and require an application server.

#### 2. How an application server works -

An application server extends the capabilities of a web server by supporting dynamic content generation, application logic, and integration with various resources.

When you attempt to access interactive content on a website, the process works as follows:

a. The browser uses the URL to finds the server’s IP address.

b. The browser sends an HTTP request for information.

c.The web server transfers the request to the application server.

d. The application server applies business logic and communicates with other servers and third-party systems to fulfil the request.

e. The application server renders a new HTML page and returns it as a response to the web server.

f. The web server returns the response to the browser.

g. The browser displays the information to you.

To use the example of an ecommerce website, when you add items to your cart, or check out items, you interact with the application server.

#### 4. Types of Applications: 

##### Standalone Application - 
A standalone application is a software program designed in such a way that to run this software program, users don’t need an internet connection or any server access.

##### Web Application - 
Web-based applications need an internet connection, servers, and any additional resources to run. 
Suppose you want to connect with a web application, you need multiple servers. 

If you want to connect data stored applications, then it requires a database server where all the data gets stored to send.


#### 5. What is application maintenance? - 

Application maintenance is the continuous process of updating, modifying, and re-assessing the existing software application in order to make it bug-free or improve performance. Application maintenance must be a constant task that ensures the application is running smoothly without any errors.

#### Application Support - 
Application support usually offers technical support and human support. Technical support relates to the maintenance of the app, software and other organisations' technological systems. Human support relates to helping the end-user understand how to use the application or system and help solve any issues.


#### 6. What is a Data Centre?
A Data Centre is like a place where lots of computers are placed and store all the data, and transmit the stored data with the help of cables and is located in the sea.
